For example, `X-Powered-By: Express` is sent in every HTTP request coming from Express, by default. This won't provide much security benefit ([as discussed here](https://github.com/strongloop/express/pull/2813#issuecomment-159270428)), but might help a tiny bit. It will also improve performance by reducing the number of bytes sent.\n\n```javascript\nvar hidePoweredBy = require('hide-powered-by')\napp.use(hidePoweredBy())\n```\n\nYou can also explicitly set the header to something else, if you want. This could throw people off:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' }))\n```\n\nNote: if you're using Express, you don't need this middleware and can just do this:\n\n```javascript\napp.disable('x-powered-by')\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"evanhahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-06-27T20:03:48.193Z","created":"2014-10-28T14:05:43.752Z","0.1.0":"2014-10-28T14:05:43.752Z","1.0.0":"2015-12-18T18:42:55.823Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/helmetjs/hide-powered-by#readme","keywords":["helmet","security","express","connect","x-powered-by","powered-by"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/helmetjs/hide-powered-by.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Evan Hahn","email":"me@evanhahn.com","url":"http://evanhahn.com"}],"author":{"name":"Adam Baldwin","email":"baldwin@andyet.net","url":"http://andyet.net/team/baldwin"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/helmetjs/hide-powered-by/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","license":"MIT","users":{"hugovila":true,"rocket0191":true,"colkito":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"5952ba24-1262\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 20:03:48 GMT"}
